Heart disease is more common than ever. In order to ensure that more people may live healthy lives, effective data-driven methods for predicting cardiac problems can enhance the overall research and prevention process. Machine learning is useful in this situation. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

This project involves proper data processing and analysis of the patient dataset for heart disease. Following that, many models were trained, and various methods were used to make predictions like KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression etc. 
Machine Learning algorithms used:
1.	Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
2.	Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
3.	Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
4.	K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
5.	Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
6.	Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

Accuracy achieved: 88.52% (Random Forest)
